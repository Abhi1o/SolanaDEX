# Swap Error Solution: "Insufficient Balance"

## Problem Summary

You're getting an "Insufficient token balance" error when trying to swap 12 USDC for SOL, even though the UI shows you have 500,000 USDC.

## Root Cause

The error **"Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit"** from the Solana transaction simulation means:

**You actually have ZERO USDC tokens in your wallet on-chain.**

The balance shown in the UI (500,000 USDC) is either:
1. Cached/stale data
2. Mock/placeholder data
3. From a different wallet/network

## The Fix

### Option 1: Use CLI Scripts (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Check your actual balance

```bash
node scripts/check-balance.js YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

Replace `YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS` with your connected wallet address (e.g., `HzkaW8LY5uDaDpSvEscSEcrTnngSgwAvsQZzVzCk6TvX`).

#### Step 2: Get SOL for transaction fees

Visit: https://faucet.solana.com/

Request at least 1 SOL to your wallet.

#### Step 3: Mint test tokens

```bash
node scripts/mint-test-tokens.js YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS 10000
```

This will mint 10,000 of each token (USDC, SOL, USDT, ETH) to your wallet.

#### Step 4: Verify and swap

```bash
# Check balance again
node scripts/check-balance.js YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS

# Refresh your browser
# Try the swap again
```

### Option 2: Use Your Working Node.js Script

Your working script already handles this by minting tokens automatically:

```javascript
// From your working script
const sourceCheck = await getAccount(connection, userSourceAccount.address);
if (Number(sourceCheck.amount) < swapAmount) {
  await mintTo(
    connection,
    payer,
    new PublicKey(pool.tokenA),
    userSourceAccount.address,
    payer,
    swapAmount
  );
}
```

You can run your script to mint and swap in one go:

```bash
node your-working-script.js
```

## Understanding the Console Output

From your console log:

```
🔄 Building Swap Transaction...
  Pool: DDPtBRGoS4tSHcvguQgseX2SoZVM2JgrEyVgkDMPfrVr
  Shard: 4
  Input: 12 USDC
  Expected Output: 0.119636 SOL
  Min Output (0.5% slippage): 0.119038 SOL
  Price Impact: 0.30%
  
📝 Transaction built successfully
✅ Transaction signed
📤 Sending transaction to Solana...

❌ Swap execution error: SendTransactionError: Simulation failed. 
Message: Transaction simulation failed: Attempt to debit an account but found no record of a prior credit.
```

This shows:
- ✅ Transaction was built correctly
- ✅ You signed it successfully
- ❌ Simulation failed because you have zero USDC

The transaction never actually executes - it fails during the preflight simulation when Solana checks if you have the tokens.

## Why the UI Shows Wrong Balance

The `TokenBalances` component fetches real on-chain data, but:

1. **It might be showing cached data** from a previous session
2. **The refresh interval** (10 seconds) might not have updated yet
3. **You might have switched wallets** and the UI hasn't refreshed

To force a refresh:
- Disconnect and reconnect your wallet
- Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check the browser console for the actual balance fetch logs

## Token Addresses (Devnet)

Make sure you're using these exact token mints:

```json
{
  "USDC": "BJYyjsX1xPbjL661mozEnU2vPf5gznbZAdGRXQh9Gufa",
  "SOL": "7YGTPNq1Xw1AWt4BfDqd82DAvmyNLEC1RdHzJX9PDB5r",
  "USDT": "F7CVt32PGjVCJo7N4PS4qUzXVMBQBj3iV4qCVFdHgseu",
  "ETH": "7K7yLbVHtvcP6zUk6KCCyedDLFuLdNu1eawvsL13LPd"
}
```

## Verification Checklist

Before trying to swap again:

- [ ] Connected to **Devnet** (not Mainnet)
- [ ] Have at least **0.5 SOL** for transaction fees
- [ ] Have the **input token** (USDC) in your wallet
- [ ] Verified balance with `check-balance.js` script
- [ ] Refreshed the browser after minting tokens
- [ ] Checked browser console for any errors

## Next Steps

1. **Run the check-balance script** to see your actual on-chain balance
2. **Mint test tokens** using the mint-test-tokens script
3. **Refresh your browser** to update the UI
4. **Try the swap again**

I've created these helper files for you:

2. **`scripts/mint-test-tokens.js`** - Mint test tokens to your wallet
3. **`GET_TEST_TOKENS.md`** - Detailed guide for getting test tokens
4. **`src/lib/mintTestTokens.ts`** - TypeScript utilities for token minting (for future UI integration)

## The Swap Code is Working!

The good news: **Your swap transaction code is correct!** 

The transaction was:
- ✅ Built successfully with correct accounts
- ✅ Signed by your wallet
- ✅ Sent to Solana

It only failed because you don't have tokens. Once you mint tokens, the swap will work perfectly.

---

**TL;DR**: You need to mint test tokens to your wallet. Run:

```bash
node scripts/check-balance.js YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
node scripts/mint-test-tokens.js YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS 10000
```

Then refresh your browser and try swapping again.
