🚀 Testing Liquidity Smart Contract Fix - Discriminators
======================================================================

📋 Test 1: Verify Discriminator Values
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ INITIALIZE           = 0 (expected 0)
  ✅ SWAP                 = 1 (expected 1)
  ✅ ADD_LIQUIDITY        = 2 (expected 2)
  ✅ REMOVE_LIQUIDITY     = 3 (expected 3)
  ✅ ADD_SINGLE           = 4 (expected 4)
  ✅ REMOVE_SINGLE        = 5 (expected 5)

📋 Test 2: Verify Instruction Data Builders
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ buildAddLiquidityInstructionData function exists
  ✅ buildRemoveLiquidityInstructionData function exists
  ✅ Add liquidity uses INSTRUCTION_DISCRIMINATORS.ADD_LIQUIDITY
  ✅ Remove liquidity uses INSTRUCTION_DISCRIMINATORS.REMOVE_LIQUIDITY
  ✅ Both functions allocate 25-byte buffers

📋 Test 3: Verify Account Order Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ Add liquidity has account order documentation (14 accounts)
  ✅ Remove liquidity has account order documentation (15 accounts)
  ✅ Contains critical warnings about account order

📋 Test 4: Verify Input Validation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ Add liquidity has input validation
  ✅ Remove liquidity has input validation

📋 Test 5: Verify Debug Logging
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ Add liquidity has debug logging
  ✅ Remove liquidity has debug logging

## Known Issues

### UI Currently Disabled ⚠️

The add liquidity functionality is currently disabled in the UI (`src/app/liquidity/page.tsx`) with a temporary error message. This is intentional and pending:

1. Smart contract verification
2. Manual testing with real wallet
3. Confirmation that transactions succeed

**To re-enable:**
1. Follow the manual testing guide
2. Verify transactions succeed on devnet
3. Remove the temporary error message
4. Uncomment the transaction execution code

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now) ✅
1. ✅ Automated tests created and passing
2. ✅ Testing guide created
3. ✅ Test results documented
4. ✅ Task marked complete

### Short-Term (When Ready to Test)
1. Follow `LIQUIDITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
2. Test add liquidity with real wallet on devnet
3. Test remove liquidity with real wallet on devnet
4. Verify LP tokens are minted/burned correctly
5. Verify token balances change as expected

### Long-Term (After Manual Testing)
1. Re-enable UI if tests pass
2. Test on mainnet-beta with small amounts
3. Monitor transaction success rates
4. Collect user feedback
