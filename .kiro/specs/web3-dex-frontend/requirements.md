# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Web3 Decentralized Exchange (DEX) frontend application. The system enables users to connect their browser wallets, create liquidity pools, and perform token swaps in a decentralized manner. The application provides a complete trading interface with pool management capabilities and seamless Web3 wallet integration.

## Glossary

- **DEX_Frontend**: The main decentralized exchange frontend application
- **Wallet_Connector**: The component responsible for integrating with Web3 browser wallets
- **Pool_Manager**: The system component that handles liquidity pool creation and management
- **Swap_Engine**: The component that processes token swap transactions
- **User_Interface**: The visual interface through which users interact with the DEX
- **Liquidity_Pool**: A smart contract containing paired tokens that enables trading
- **Token_Pair**: Two different cryptocurrencies that can be traded against each other
- **Wallet_Address**: The unique blockchain address associated with a user's wallet
- **Transaction_Hash**: A unique identifier for blockchain transactions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Web3 user, I want to connect my browser wallet to the DEX, so that I can interact with the application using my cryptocurrency assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the wallet connection button, THE Wallet_Connector SHALL display available Web3 wallets in the browser
2. WHEN a user selects a wallet, THE Wallet_Connector SHALL initiate the connection request to the selected wallet
3. WHEN the wallet connection is successful, THE DEX_Frontend SHALL display the connected Wallet_Address in the user interface
4. WHEN the wallet connection fails, THE Wallet_Connector SHALL display an error message explaining the connection failure
5. WHILE a wallet is connected, THE DEX_Frontend SHALL maintain the connection state throughout the user session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a liquidity provider, I want to create new liquidity pools, so that I can provide liquidity for token pairs and earn trading fees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connected user accesses the pool creation interface, THE Pool_Manager SHALL display input fields for selecting two tokens
2. WHEN a user selects valid Token_Pair combinations, THE Pool_Manager SHALL validate that the tokens are supported
3. WHEN a user specifies liquidity amounts for both tokens, THE Pool_Manager SHALL calculate the initial exchange rate
4. WHEN a user confirms pool creation, THE Pool_Manager SHALL initiate the blockchain transaction for pool deployment
5. WHEN the pool creation transaction is confirmed, THE DEX_Frontend SHALL display the new Liquidity_Pool in the user's pool list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view all available liquidity pools, so that I can see trading opportunities and pool statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Interface SHALL display a comprehensive list of all available Liquidity_Pool instances
2. WHEN displaying pools, THE User_Interface SHALL show token pair names, total liquidity, and trading volume for each pool
3. WHEN a user clicks on a pool, THE User_Interface SHALL display detailed pool information including current exchange rates
4. THE User_Interface SHALL update pool information in real-time as new transactions occur
5. WHEN pools have insufficient liquidity, THE User_Interface SHALL indicate low liquidity warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to swap tokens through the DEX interface, so that I can exchange one cryptocurrency for another at current market rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects tokens to swap, THE Swap_Engine SHALL calculate the expected output amount based on current pool ratios
2. WHEN a user enters a swap amount, THE Swap_Engine SHALL display the estimated received amount and price impact
3. WHEN a user confirms a swap, THE Swap_Engine SHALL initiate the blockchain transaction with the specified parameters
4. WHEN the swap transaction is pending, THE User_Interface SHALL display transaction status and Transaction_Hash
5. WHEN the swap is completed, THE DEX_Frontend SHALL update the user's token balances and transaction history

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my transaction history and portfolio, so that I can track my trading activity and current holdings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE a wallet is connected, THE DEX_Frontend SHALL display the user's current token balances
2. THE User_Interface SHALL maintain a history of all user transactions including swaps and pool interactions
3. WHEN displaying transaction history, THE User_Interface SHALL show transaction type, amounts, timestamps, and Transaction_Hash
4. THE DEX_Frontend SHALL calculate and display portfolio value changes over time
5. WHEN transactions are pending, THE User_Interface SHALL clearly indicate pending status with appropriate visual indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blockchain transactions fail, THE DEX_Frontend SHALL display clear error messages explaining the failure reason
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur, THE User_Interface SHALL show appropriate offline indicators
3. IF insufficient token balances exist for a transaction, THEN THE Swap_Engine SHALL prevent the transaction and display balance requirements
4. WHEN wallet interactions are rejected by the user, THE Wallet_Connector SHALL handle the rejection gracefully without breaking the interface
5. THE DEX_Frontend SHALL provide helpful guidance for common error scenarios such as network switching or insufficient gas fees
