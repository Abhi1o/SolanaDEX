# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the liquidity addition user experience by creating a seamless, single-screen flow where users select tokens and input amounts without modal popups. The enhancement will minimize context switching and create a more intuitive, flowing experience where the interface adapts progressively as users make selections.

## Glossary

- **Liquidity Interface**: The UI component where users add liquidity to pools
- **Token Selector**: The dropdown/card component for selecting tokens
- **Amount Input Card**: The expandable card component where users enter token amounts
- **Minimized State**: A collapsed view of the token selector showing only selected tokens
- **Expanded State**: The full view of the token selector or amount input card
- **Progressive Disclosure**: A UX pattern where interface elements are revealed progressively based on user actions
- **Token Logo**: The visual icon representing a specific token

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single-Screen Liquidity Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add liquidity without modal popups, so that I stay on the same screen and maintain context throughout the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display all token selection and amount input components on a single screen without modal overlays
2. WHEN the user interacts with token selection, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL update the view inline without opening popup modals
3. WHEN the user completes token selection, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL transition smoothly to the amount input step on the same screen
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL maintain visual continuity throughout the entire liquidity addition process
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL provide clear visual feedback for each step without disrupting the user's focus

### Requirement 2: Progressive Token Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want token selectors to minimize after I make my selection, so that I can see my choices clearly and the interface feels organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has not selected a token, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display the token selector in an expanded state
2. WHEN the user selects the first token, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL minimize the first token selector to show only the selected token with its logo
3. WHEN the user selects the second token, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL minimize the second token selector to show only the selected token with its logo
4. WHEN both tokens are selected, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display both minimized token selectors with selected tokens and logos visible
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL provide a way to change token selections by expanding the minimized selector when clicked

### Requirement 3: Expandable Amount Input

**User Story:** As a user, I want the amount input card to expand automatically after I select both tokens, so that the next step is clear and the flow feels natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has not selected both tokens, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL keep the amount input card collapsed or hidden
2. WHEN the user selects both tokens, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL automatically expand the amount input card with a smooth animation
3. THE Amount Input Card SHALL display input fields for both selected tokens with their respective logos
4. THE Amount Input Card SHALL show the user's available balance for each token
5. THE Amount Input Card SHALL provide MAX buttons to quickly input the full available balance

### Requirement 4: Token Logo Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see token logos throughout the interface, so that I can quickly identify tokens visually and the UI feels polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display token logos in the token selector dropdown options
2. WHEN a token is selected, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display the token logo in the minimized token selector
3. THE Amount Input Card SHALL display token logos next to each amount input field
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display token logos in the pool information summary
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL use fallback icons or placeholders for tokens without logo images

### Requirement 5: Smooth Transitions and Animations

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions between interface states, so that the experience feels fluid and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token selector minimizes, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL animate the transition with a smooth collapse effect
2. WHEN the amount input card expands, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL animate the expansion with a smooth slide-down or fade-in effect
3. WHEN the user changes a token selection, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL animate the token swap with a smooth transition
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL use consistent easing functions for all animations to create a cohesive feel
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL complete all animations within 300-500ms to maintain responsiveness

### Requirement 6: Clear Visual Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to guide me through the steps clearly, so that I always know what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL use visual emphasis (size, color, position) to highlight the current active step
2. WHEN token selection is incomplete, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL visually emphasize the token selectors
3. WHEN both tokens are selected, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL visually emphasize the amount input card
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL use subtle visual cues (opacity, scale) to de-emphasize completed steps
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL maintain a clear top-to-bottom flow: token selection → amount input → action button

### Requirement 7: Responsive Amount Input Logic

**User Story:** As a user, I want the amount inputs to work intelligently, so that I can easily specify how much liquidity to add.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters an amount for the first token, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL automatically calculate and display the proportional amount for the second token based on the pool ratio
2. WHEN the user enters an amount for the second token, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL automatically calculate and display the proportional amount for the first token based on the pool ratio
3. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL validate that entered amounts do not exceed available balances
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display clear error messages for invalid amounts
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL update calculated amounts in real-time as the user types

### Requirement 8: Pool Information Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see relevant pool information as I add liquidity, so that I can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both tokens are selected, THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display the current pool ratio
2. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display the user's share of the pool after adding liquidity
3. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display estimated LP tokens to be received
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL display the pool's current liquidity (TVL)
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL update all pool information in real-time as amounts change

### Requirement 9: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the liquidity interface to be fully accessible, so that I can add liquidity independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL support full keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
2. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL provide clear focus indicators for keyboard users
3. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL include appropriate ARIA labels for all interactive components
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL announce state changes to screen readers
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements

### Requirement 10: Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the liquidity interface to work seamlessly on my device, so that I can add liquidity on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL adapt the layout appropriately for mobile screens (< 768px)
2. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL maintain touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44x44px)
3. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL optimize animations for mobile performance
4. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL ensure all text remains readable on small screens
5. THE Liquidity Interface SHALL prevent layout shifts during transitions on mobile devices
