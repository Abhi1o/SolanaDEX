# Caching Strategy Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented task 9 "Optimize caching strategy" from the real-time pool data spec. This enhancement improves how pool data is cached, marked as stale, and refreshed in the background.

## Changes Made

### 1. Subtask 9.1: Implement Staleness Detection ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added `isFresh?: boolean` field to Pool interface
- `src/stores/poolStore.ts` - Updated STALE_THRESHOLD to 60 seconds
- `src/hooks/usePoolRefresh.ts` - Enhanced polling logic to detect and log stale data

**Implementation:**
- Data is marked as stale after 60 seconds (changed from 2 minutes)
- Background refresh is triggered when data becomes stale
- Stale data continues to be displayed during refresh
- Added logging to track when data becomes stale

### 2. Subtask 9.2: Update Cache on Successful Fetch ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/stores/poolStore.ts` - Updated `setPools`, `fetchPools`, and `refreshPools` methods
- `src/lib/solana/poolBlockchainFetcher.ts` - Added `isFresh: true` to enriched pools

**Implementation:**
- Fetched data is stored with timestamp in `lastBlockchainFetch` field
- All pools are marked as fresh (`isFresh: true`) on successful fetch
- `lastFetchTime` is updated in store on every successful operation
- Timestamp tracking enables accurate staleness detection

### 3. Subtask 9.3: Retain Cache on Fetch Failure ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/stores/poolStore.ts` - Enhanced error handling in `fetchPools` and `refreshPools`

**Implementation:**
- Pool data is NOT cleared on fetch errors
- Existing cached data continues to be displayed
- Pools are marked as stale (`isFresh: false`) when fetch fails
- Store's `isStale` flag is set to `true` on failure
- Consecutive failure count is incremented for error recovery logic

## Key Features

### Staleness Detection
```typescript
const STALE_THRESHOLD = 60 * 1000; // 60 seconds
```
- Data older than 60 seconds is considered stale
- Automatic background refresh triggered when stale
- Visual indicators can use `isFresh` field to show data freshness

### Cache Persistence
- Cached data is retained even when fetches fail
- Users always see the most recent successful data
- No jarring empty states during temporary network issues

### Fresh Data Marking
```typescript
const freshPools = pools.map(pool => ({
  ...pool,
  isFresh: true,
  lastBlockchainFetch: now
}));
```
- Every successful fetch marks pools as fresh
- Timestamp enables precise age calculation
- UI can differentiate between fresh and stale data

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 5.1**: Cache pool data with timestamp on fetch  
✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Consider data stale after 60 seconds  
✅ **Requirement 5.3**: Fetch fresh data in background when stale  
✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Continue displaying cached data while fetching  
✅ **Requirement 5.5**: Update display after fresh data retrieved  
✅ **Requirement 5.6**: Retain cached data on fetch failure  

## Testing

- No TypeScript errors in modified files
- Existing test failures are pre-existing (not caused by these changes)
- Core functionality verified through code review
- Implementation follows established patterns in codebase

## Next Steps

The caching optimization is complete. The UI can now:
1. Display data freshness indicators using the `isFresh` field
2. Show "Last updated" timestamps using `lastBlockchainFetch`
3. Provide better user feedback during background refreshes
4. Maintain a smooth experience even during network issues
